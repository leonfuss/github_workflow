Message for the Aliens:

Hello, it's me (from Earth)

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet (the human species)
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing (our planet is falling apart)

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm on Earth dreaming about who we used to be (and who we could be)
When we were younger and free (please help us)
I've forgotten how it felt before climate change and pollution fell at our feet
There's such a (lightyear) difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side (still Earth)
