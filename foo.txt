FUBAR (Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Repair/Recognition/Reason), like SNAFU and SUSFU, dates from World War II. 
The Oxford English Dictionary lists Yank, the Army Weekly magazine (1944, 7 Jan. p. 8) as its earliest citation: 
"The FUBAR squadron. â€¥ FUBAR? It means 'Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition," referring to unpaid military personnel 
with erroneous paperwork.

One possible origin of the term comes from the German word "furchtbar" meaning frightful, negative, or bad. 
A skilled German speaker pronouncing the word would say something which to an anglo would sound like "Foitebar". 
Being unable to collectively pronounce the German "rcht" spelling inflection, but knowing the word's pronunciation wasn't 
greatly modified by it, an Anglo would naturally simplify it to "Fuubar/Fubar" in common usage. 
A similar scenario had occurred with French "m'aidez" ("help me") becoming "Mayday" in WWI; 
with contractions not being common in English verbs it was translated as a single word.
