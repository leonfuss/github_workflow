# Ingredients
45ml lemon vodka
15ml triple sec
30ml cranberry juice
10ml lime juice
ice

# For the garnish
orange zest, or a lime wedge on the rim of the glass.

# Method
## STEP 1
Shake ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.

## STEP 2
To make the garnish: hold a 3cm round piece of orange zest about 10cm above your cosmo and very carefully wave it over a lit match or lighter flame. Bend the outer edge of the zest in towards the flame so that the orange oils are released, then drop the zest into your drink.
